    "In this notebook, we will walk you through the steps of converting a machine learning model, which you may already have on a jupyter notebook, into a Kubeflow pipeline. As an example, we will make use of the fashion we will make use of the fashion MNIST dataset and the [Basic classification with Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification) example.\n",

    "* **Kubeflow pipelines** - [Kubeflow Pipelines](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/overview/pipelines-overview/) is a machine learning workflow platform that is helping data scientists and ML engineers tackle experimentation and productionization of ML workloads. It allows users to easily orchestrate scalable workloads using an SDK right from the comfort of a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
